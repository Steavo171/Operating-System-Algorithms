# Operating-System-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems and computer science.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Banker's Algorithm**: A deadlock avoidance algorithm used in resource allocation.
2. **First Fit**: A memory allocation algorithm for placing data in memory partitions.
3. **Producer-Consumer**: A classic synchronization problem involving two types of processes.
4. **Round Robin**: A preemptive scheduling algorithm for CPU processes.
5. **First Come, First Served (FCFS)**: A non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first is executed first.
